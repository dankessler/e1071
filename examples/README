# Weighted Instance SVM (winsvm)

# example_data.R

- This script produces a .csv file with data for testing the instance weighted SVM in R and Python

- The .csv data includes 12 features for the SVM, a column of inverse probability weights derived from logisitic regression, and a column of binary class labels.

# fit_R_winsvm.R

- This script fits an instance weighted SVM and an unweighted SVM in R for comparison with Python (scikit learn) output.
